## 🤠About This Fork🐴

The goal of this fork is to improve upon the mainline Simply Love theme. The upstream maintainers are very particular in what they will accept as a pull request based on their own personal idea of what the theme should be. I take a far more progressive approach to my fork and will actively look to merge new and interesting ideas from the many forks out there. Sometimes though, my fork aims to clean up /many/ of the inconsistencies and general UI oddities that plague the mainline branch. I hope you enjoy this fork if you find that you prefer it to the mainline theme.

The new features that exist in this fork are listed below:

✅ Re-added vocalize support

You'll need to download the old vocalize pack [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/i8osxoy3h2ikdbj/Vocalize.zip/file) and place it in ~/Other/

If you placed the Vocalize pack correctly, the option to select a vocalization will appear in the "Advanced Options" page in Player Options, all the way at the bottom.

✅ Display "Song Folder" or "Group" On SelectMusic and Evaluation

SongDescription on ScreenSelectMusic and TitleAndBanner on ScreenEvaluation have been reworked to show either the song folder or song group from the currently selected song. There is a preference in Simple Love Options to toggle between the two; the default is to display the song Group. This is especially useful when sorting by anything other than group in the SongWheel. The rework of ScreenEvaluation shows only the current group because I don't see a need to display the exact folder a song is in on Evaluation.

✅ Expand Personal Highscore name to 9 characters (configurable in Simply Love Options)

✅ Added a clock on ScreenSelectMusic in CoinMode_Home. This is useful for home players that want to keep track of the time while playing.

✅ Moved "Has Edit" graphic to outside the SongWheel to give more room for the SongTitle in the MusicWheel. This implementation is much cleaner.

✅ There is now a preference to display the group banner for songs that do not have a banner. This is configurable in Simply Love Options. When a song group (pack) has a banner, but a song does not have a banner, the song group (pack) banner will be shown. When there is no group (pack) banner, and a song does not have a banner, the default banner will be shown. The default is to show the group banner when no banner is present.

## About

Simply Love is a StepMania 5 theme for the post-ITG community.

It features a clean and simple design, offers numerous data-driven features not implemented by the StepMania 5 engine, and allows the current generation of ITG fans to breathe new life into the game they've known for over a decade.

Simply Love was originally designed and implemented for a previous version of StepMania (SM3.95) by hurtpiggypig.  For more information on that version of Simply Love, check here:

## Supported Versions of StepMania

Simply Love is compatible with current releases from the official StepMania project.

**Compatible Releases**<br>
✅ [StepMania 5.0.12](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.0.12)<br>
✅ [StepMania 5.1-b2](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.1.0-b2)<br>
✅ [StepMania 5.3-a4.9.7 (OutFox)](https://projectmoon.dance/releases/5.3.0-alpha-4.9.7GG) (preliminary support)<br>

For new installations we currently recommend installing StepMania 5.1. While
5.0.12 is officially the latest stable release of StepMania, 5.1 is widely used
and an improvement over 5.0 in almost every regard. StepMania 5.3 (Outfox) is
currently in an alpha stage of development. Check it out, though. The project
is making great progress!

If you are able to compile StepMania's source code yourself, the [5_1-new branch](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/tree/5_1-new/) is supported.  The wiki has [instructions for compiling](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Compiling-StepMania).


**Incompatible**<br>
❌ Forks of SM5 (e.g. *starworlds*)<br>
❌ Older versions of StepMania (e.g. StepMania 3.9)<br>
❌ Forks of older versions of StepMania (e.g. OpenITG, NotITG)<br>
❌ SM5.2
